# Compare-CSV-Files

1.  This Python3 program allows for the comparison of two CSV files, and it shows differences and similarities by using union, difference, and Pandas merge functions. The two CSV files provided are demonstration data (Fruits.csv and Vegetables.csv) but the data could be modified to suit your own CSV data.

2.  Run the program by entering: python3 CompareCSVFiles.py

3.  Enter the location of the directory containing the demonstration CSV files.

4.  These commands are available:
    
    ```
    compare_to_fruit_values
    #Compares the vegetable values to fruit values.

    compare_to_vegetable_values
    #Compares the fruit values to vegetable values.

    show_fruits_vegetables
    #Shows all the fruit and vegetable values.

    merge
    #Merge the vegetable and fruit spreadsheet files and show all their ID's and values.```
